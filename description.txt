MedConnect Hub is supposed to be the new tehnological bridge between clinics, doctors and patients. 
The patients would be able to connect directly to the clinic and their doctors, accesing all the info from the consultation and being notified when
to take their pills, also informing them about what could happen if they didnt. Another fucntionality of MedConnect Hub is helping keep track and motivation
throughout the user's journey of quitting the habit to smoke. How it works, you tell the app that you want to quit, specify information about how many
packets of cigarettes you smoke every week and the app keeps track of your progress, reminding you of all things that could and do happen if you quit smoking.
Going back to the connection between the patient and the clinic/doctors, after the consultation, the patient would be shown the app, clinic code and the
doctor's ID to whom they went, afterwards, the doctor would be able to leave notes and tell the app what pills the patient should take. The patient would then
be able to tell the app that they had taken the pill, after they had been notified, which will eliminate completely the problem of forgetting to take your
pills and also would eliminate the inexsitence of trust between the normal human and the prescription, everything being monitorised by the doctors and the app
alike.
